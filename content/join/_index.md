    <p>
      Thank you for your interest in joining our group — unfortunately, we are not accepting PhD students anymore.
    </p>

      If you are interested in working with us as a Master's student, please see <a href="https://master-program-link">here</a>. Ryan has previously co-advised Master's students on NLP topics with <a href="https://www.mrinmaya.io/" target="_blank">Mrinmaya Sachan</a> and others.

      To obtain a better understanding of what currently interests us, check out our most recent publications. For Bachelor theses or semester projects, we typically assign you one of our published papers to replicate — it would be ideal if you indicate 3-4 publications that interest you.
